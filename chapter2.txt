I wanna make a good cover story for this book! 
So far it's going not great. Well, you know how life is sometimes...
Yes that's enough.

The king in the night wanted some time alone.
He closed his door. 
Who wwould have know what would happen on this cloudy night...
This cold night, The king was so tired.
He laid on his bed, started watching his favorite show on Netflix
When all of a sudden, the window blew apart!
Smoke and fire well all in his room.
He could not escape. So with his sword in hands, he cried with all the air in his lungs.

Who the fuck are you and what do you want from me!
